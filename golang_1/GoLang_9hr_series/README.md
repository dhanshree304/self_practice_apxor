...when u declare variable u can give it a type or also can declare it without declaring its type

or also can write with shorthand syntax ...without let var const and without giving type ...shorthand is use in only inside function

with var only we can update the variable let doesnt exist in golang

...for is the only loop we used in golang and not while or do while loop
for is only construct in go for looping 

we can not use '' single strings in golang

functions in go are able to return multiple values

if we are returning in fun then only needs return type ..otherwise for fmt,pl not need type to return
